#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to solve an inventory retrieval system for a grocery store.  The program displays a menu to the user in which they can choose to either search for one item, or print a collective list of the entire inventory.  It displays either the single item and quantity, or the entire inventory and quantity in numerical format or as a histogram.

#What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did everything on this project very well, but specifically my function to receive input and validate it from the user.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
With this project I spent a lot of time ensuring I used the best practices I know and made edits along the way.  I am sure a way exists to make this more efficient, however I do not know it currently.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The only part I found challenging was outputting the correct values from the map.  I went through zyBooks chapter on maps, and used a C++ forum to better understand how to use auto& to pass both key and value as the loop iterates.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Using maps I am sure will be immeasurably valuable in other projects both in school and future career.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to create a main function that contains very little code.  Writing every step in the process into its own function allows future adapting very easy.  It is commented thoroughly to allow easy editing should it ever be needed, and I always try to format my code with the correct amount of whitespace and separation to allow it to be easy to follow for whoever may read it.
